https://kaiyuanshe.cn/activity/coscon-2023

COSCon'23  is stand for China Open Source Conference 2023 , it's the eighth conference hold by KAIYUANSHE in China.

Here is the topics from this year:

__Main Forum (Plenary)__  
The three-year COVID-19 epidemic has not defeated us. After the epidemic, Kaiyuan colleagues gathered in Chengdu, Sichuan. This magnificent scene of "hundreds of rivers reaching the sea" is just like the ecological picture of Kaiyuan gathering people's will and endless life, which is called "the continuous flow". COSCon 2021 joins hands with the local open source community in Chengdu to use the open-air lawn market as the main offline venue, setting a precedent for China and leading Kyushu to follow suit. In 2023, Chengdu will become the main venue. The lawn market will still adhere to the purpose of "everyone is a wave in the sea" and organically combine this "sea meeting" format with the classic speech "summit", which is called "mountain and sea". Reflecting each other." We hope that this year’s feast of China’s open source community will allow important open source participants such as communities, enterprises, foundations, and governments to have in-depth exchanges and open up ideas for the next decade of open source development in China. Main points of the conference


__Open Source Bazaar__  
During this conference, we will hold a two-day lawn open source party offline in Chengdu, and work with the local open source community in Chengdu to prepare for the “Open Source Market” to recreate the grand occasion of COSCon’2021.


__Web Application Development__  
Topics cover web front-end and back-end application frameworks and open source projects in related technical fields.


__Open Source Operating System__  
This special session focuses on the development of operating system technology and the opportunities and challenges faced by the open source ecosystem. It gathers the core technology experts of the current mainstream operating systems at home and abroad to share hot technical topics on the development status of open source operating systems. The content covers the system kernel, desktop environment, In terms of application ecology and talent training, we will take you to appreciate the rapid development momentum of the current open source operating system.

__Open Source for Teenagers__  
Teenagers are the future of open source. This sub-forum is organized by teenagers themselves, mainly middle and high school students. The goal is to promote open source culture among middle school students and even elementary school students, develop open source technology, and guide teenagers to actively participate in open source. The format of this sub-forum is a workshop, and its target audience is primary and secondary school students who are interested in technology.


__Open Source Treasure Chest__  
"If you want to do your job well, you must first sharpen your tools" - The open source treasure box provides open source tools for the open source community and developers to help everyone participate in the collaboration of the open source community better, faster and easier, including community Governance, project management, risk management and other tools or platforms, such as Kaiyuan Society’s open hackathon platform, OSS.Chat, Xiaoyuan Robot, open source contribution incentive platform KToken, etc., as well as tools and platforms provided by third-party communities. Let’s join together and enrich the open source treasure chest!


__Open Source Hardware__  
The COSCon Open Source Hardware Forum, as one of the few dedicated forums focusing on open source hardware in China, has been held at the China Open Source Annual Conference for the fifth consecutive year. In the past four years, it has covered special topics such as sharing software and hardware on the same stage as open source, working together with multiple people to build a source ecosystem, and discussing industrialization online and offline. It has focused on open source hardware-related open source chips, community operations, maker ecology, On topics such as educational innovation, industrial intelligent manufacturing, entrepreneurial incubation, standards organizations, and international promotion, the "Open Source Hardware Milestones" and "Virtual Valley Plan" were released, and open source hardware workshops were held, with more than 40 participants from many countries and regions around the world. Guest lecturers shared. This year, let us continue to collide and look forward to sharing and gaining insight into the future of open source hardware from multiple dimensions such as its technology, ecology, business model, difficulties and pain points.


__Open Source Governance__  
Open source governance has become the key to the sustainable development of the global open source ecosystem, involving many parties including enterprises, foundations, open source communities, universities, and governments. Foreign organizations like the TODO Group have set a good example in open source governance. The Open Source Society also established the ONES Group this year in the hope of promoting the development of local open source governance methodologies, tools, services and other aspects. This forum hopes to invite open source governance professionals from different organizational backgrounds to discuss the power China plays in the global open source governance system and promote the development of global open source.


__Artificial Intelligence (AI)__   
As the artificial intelligence industry is booming, tools, frameworks, computing power, and applications are constantly being updated and iterated to enrich the entire industry. Open source is becoming the core productivity in the artificial intelligence industry, bringing together more people and forces, always ready to create greater sparks.


__Open Source for Women's Forum__  
We need to hear more female voices, and we hope that women in the open source field will use their own stories and thoughts to speak out, establish female influence, and drive more female friends to join open source. This forum is open to any female friends who contribute to the open source field to apply for topics.


__Cloud Computing__  
Cloud computing and open source build infrastructure at different levels. Open source technology is infrastructure at the code level, and cloud computing is infrastructure at the resource level. On the one hand, open source technology has developed rapidly in the field of cloud computing, effectively promoting technological innovation and leading new technological paths; on the other hand, the cloud computing model has effectively promoted open source participating companies to establish business models and enriched the use models of open source technology. This COSCon'22 cloud computing forum invites in-depth participants of multiple open source projects in the field of cloud computing to share.


__Blockchain__   
Blockchain originates from the open source spirit, which lays a solid and reliable foundation of "trust" in the digital world not only from the technical level, but also from the community governance level. As a result, Internet applications and even traditional industries have more potential and greater value in the process of digitalization. Nowadays, the application of blockchain technology has extended to many fields such as digital finance, Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, digital asset transactions, etc. We hope to use blockchain technology to better reflect the open source spirit in everyone's life and work through "open source for good".


__Open Source Culture__  
As open source is accepted by the mainstream, more and more companies and individuals are participating, and everyone is beginning to look for the most fundamental content of the logic of collective action: the importance of culture. From this point of view, the important role of paying attention to culture is still to be at the forefront and pay attention to the pioneers and evangelists of future developments.

__Big Data__  
Big data has highlighted its huge value in the era of digitalization and digital intelligence. Looking around the world, big data technology at home and abroad is flourishing and hundreds of schools of thought are contending. It is the unchanging purpose of the big data forum to present wonderful technical interpretations to the majority of developers and enthusiasts! This forum mainly displays the current status and development trends of popular open source technologies in the field of big data. The project scope includes but is not limited to massive storage engines, computing scheduling engines, SQL execution engines, as well as data lake analysis, lake-warehouse integration and data governance technology and other exciting contents. .

# The Song of the Open Source People

On this submit we've an offical release song <The Song of the Open Source People>  

https://github.com/richardllin/The-Song-of-the-Open-Source-People



# What we sharing during that submit
Below is that slide Me and  Junyi Zhang Shared on that submit.  
For some reasons the record of 10-28 "Open Source Culture" part has been deleted.  
So  let me show up here again.

![02-Content](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/02.jpg "02-Content")

The whole speech is divided into 4 parts. First we've given out the official explanation of Red Hat Culture. Then Junyi will sharing the Open Management practice and his personal story with James M. Whitehurst. The next is from my part I will share my stories about what I've seen , what we've did , What I believe , because I think culture is a complicated things if you really want to feel it you have go into senarios. That is why I going to sharing the stoies not the paper rules, because it is more funny. 
![03](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/03.jpg "03")

Still there are funny things in the official explanation of Red Hat culture,  See the picture above __"our culture defines us and influences how we interact with the world"__ that is the most interesting one, cause I've been worked for about 10 years and when I was young in the outsourcing company I've seen more than 25+ companies there is no one said __"How we interact with the world"__ , but this is how we live here , and change the world, but most of us couldn't see that , but here in the Red Hat culture official explanation there it is.
