# What is COSCon'23

2023 10 28  - 10 29  ChengDo


https://kaiyuanshe.cn/activity/coscon-2023

COSCon'23  is stand for China Open Source Conference 2023 , it's the eighth conference hold by KAIYUANSHE in China.

Here is the topics from this year:

__Main Forum (Plenary)__  
The three-year COVID-19 epidemic has not defeated us. After the epidemic, Kaiyuan colleagues gathered in Chengdu, Sichuan. This magnificent scene of "hundreds of rivers reaching the sea" is just like the ecological picture of Kaiyuan gathering people's will and endless life, which is called "the continuous flow". COSCon 2021 joins hands with the local open source community in Chengdu to use the open-air lawn market as the main offline venue, setting a precedent for China and leading Kyushu to follow suit. In 2023, Chengdu will become the main venue. The lawn market will still adhere to the purpose of "everyone is a wave in the sea" and organically combine this "sea meeting" format with the classic speech "summit", which is called "mountain and sea". Reflecting each other." We hope that this year’s feast of China’s open source community will allow important open source participants such as communities, enterprises, foundations, and governments to have in-depth exchanges and open up ideas for the next decade of open source development in China. Main points of the conference


__Open Source Bazaar__  
During this conference, we will hold a two-day lawn open source party offline in Chengdu, and work with the local open source community in Chengdu to prepare for the “Open Source Market” to recreate the grand occasion of COSCon’2021.


__Web Application Development__  
Topics cover web front-end and back-end application frameworks and open source projects in related technical fields.


__Open Source Operating System__  
This special session focuses on the development of operating system technology and the opportunities and challenges faced by the open source ecosystem. It gathers the core technology experts of the current mainstream operating systems at home and abroad to share hot technical topics on the development status of open source operating systems. The content covers the system kernel, desktop environment, In terms of application ecology and talent training, we will take you to appreciate the rapid development momentum of the current open source operating system.

__Open Source for Teenagers__  
Teenagers are the future of open source. This sub-forum is organized by teenagers themselves, mainly middle and high school students. The goal is to promote open source culture among middle school students and even elementary school students, develop open source technology, and guide teenagers to actively participate in open source. The format of this sub-forum is a workshop, and its target audience is primary and secondary school students who are interested in technology.


__Open Source Treasure Chest__  
"If you want to do your job well, you must first sharpen your tools" - The open source treasure box provides open source tools for the open source community and developers to help everyone participate in the collaboration of the open source community better, faster and easier, including community Governance, project management, risk management and other tools or platforms, such as Kaiyuan Society’s open hackathon platform, OSS.Chat, Xiaoyuan Robot, open source contribution incentive platform KToken, etc., as well as tools and platforms provided by third-party communities. Let’s join together and enrich the open source treasure chest!


__Open Source Hardware__  
The COSCon Open Source Hardware Forum, as one of the few dedicated forums focusing on open source hardware in China, has been held at the China Open Source Annual Conference for the fifth consecutive year. In the past four years, it has covered special topics such as sharing software and hardware on the same stage as open source, working together with multiple people to build a source ecosystem, and discussing industrialization online and offline. It has focused on open source hardware-related open source chips, community operations, maker ecology, On topics such as educational innovation, industrial intelligent manufacturing, entrepreneurial incubation, standards organizations, and international promotion, the "Open Source Hardware Milestones" and "Virtual Valley Plan" were released, and open source hardware workshops were held, with more than 40 participants from many countries and regions around the world. Guest lecturers shared. This year, let us continue to collide and look forward to sharing and gaining insight into the future of open source hardware from multiple dimensions such as its technology, ecology, business model, difficulties and pain points.


__Open Source Governance__  
Open source governance has become the key to the sustainable development of the global open source ecosystem, involving many parties including enterprises, foundations, open source communities, universities, and governments. Foreign organizations like the TODO Group have set a good example in open source governance. The Open Source Society also established the ONES Group this year in the hope of promoting the development of local open source governance methodologies, tools, services and other aspects. This forum hopes to invite open source governance professionals from different organizational backgrounds to discuss the power China plays in the global open source governance system and promote the development of global open source.


__Artificial Intelligence (AI)__   
As the artificial intelligence industry is booming, tools, frameworks, computing power, and applications are constantly being updated and iterated to enrich the entire industry. Open source is becoming the core productivity in the artificial intelligence industry, bringing together more people and forces, always ready to create greater sparks.


__Open Source for Women's Forum__  
We need to hear more female voices, and we hope that women in the open source field will use their own stories and thoughts to speak out, establish female influence, and drive more female friends to join open source. This forum is open to any female friends who contribute to the open source field to apply for topics.


__Cloud Computing__  
Cloud computing and open source build infrastructure at different levels. Open source technology is infrastructure at the code level, and cloud computing is infrastructure at the resource level. On the one hand, open source technology has developed rapidly in the field of cloud computing, effectively promoting technological innovation and leading new technological paths; on the other hand, the cloud computing model has effectively promoted open source participating companies to establish business models and enriched the use models of open source technology. This COSCon'22 cloud computing forum invites in-depth participants of multiple open source projects in the field of cloud computing to share.


__Blockchain__   
Blockchain originates from the open source spirit, which lays a solid and reliable foundation of "trust" in the digital world not only from the technical level, but also from the community governance level. As a result, Internet applications and even traditional industries have more potential and greater value in the process of digitalization. Nowadays, the application of blockchain technology has extended to many fields such as digital finance, Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, digital asset transactions, etc. We hope to use blockchain technology to better reflect the open source spirit in everyone's life and work through "open source for good".


__Open Source Culture__  
As open source is accepted by the mainstream, more and more companies and individuals are participating, and everyone is beginning to look for the most fundamental content of the logic of collective action: the importance of culture. From this point of view, the important role of paying attention to culture is still to be at the forefront and pay attention to the pioneers and evangelists of future developments.

__Big Data__  
Big data has highlighted its huge value in the era of digitalization and digital intelligence. Looking around the world, big data technology at home and abroad is flourishing and hundreds of schools of thought are contending. It is the unchanging purpose of the big data forum to present wonderful technical interpretations to the majority of developers and enthusiasts! This forum mainly displays the current status and development trends of popular open source technologies in the field of big data. The project scope includes but is not limited to massive storage engines, computing scheduling engines, SQL execution engines, as well as data lake analysis, lake-warehouse integration and data governance technology and other exciting contents. .

# The Song of the Open Source People

On this submit we've an offical release song <The Song of the Open Source People>  

https://github.com/richardllin/The-Song-of-the-Open-Source-People



# What we sharing during that submit
Below is that slide Me and  Junyi Zhang Shared on that submit.  
For some reasons the record of 10-28 "Open Source Culture" part has been deleted.  
So  let me show up here again.

![02-Content](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/02.jpg "02-Content")

The whole speech is divided into 4 parts. First we've given out the official explanation of Red Hat Culture. Then Junyi will sharing the Open Management practice and his personal story with James M. Whitehurst. The next is from my part I will share my stories about what I've seen , what we've did , What I believe , because I think culture is a complicated things if you really want to feel it you have go into senarios. That is why I going to sharing the stoies not the paper rules, because it is more funny.   
![03](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/03.jpg "03")

Still there are funny things in the official explanation of Red Hat culture,  See the picture above __"our culture defines us and influences how we interact with the world"__ that is the most interesting one, cause I've been worked for about 10 years and when I was young in the outsourcing company I've seen more than 25+ companies there is no one said __"How we interact with the world"__ , but this is how we live here , and change the world, but most of us couldn't see that , but here in the Red Hat culture official explanation there it is.
<!-- ![04](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/04.jpg "04") -->

![05](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/05.jpg "05")
For a long time I'm keep thinking about how to explain what culture it is to others it feels like a rain cloud above my head for decades。 Recently I was notice that there was an open day of No.11 Experimental School, which is one of the best school of Beijing, and during that open day I accidently found there were four simple sentences explain what culture it is.  

>Rooted in inner cultivation.  
>A self-awareness that requires no reminder.  
>The freedom based on restraint.  
>The kindness that considers others.  

Well , I think that will stands for the standard answer of "what is the culture" in my head for a long time.

![06](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/06.jpg "06")
OK, back to the stories, In Red Hat we are focus on "Getting things done" no the Clocking in.  

![07](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/07.jpg "07")
And if you are new associate of Red Hat ,you will have a book <Book of Red Hat> there is a story about that Red Fedora , which is the Hat of Red Hat's logo.  

![08](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/08.jpg "08")

As you can see the original hat is a baseball hat at the right up corner.

![09](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/09.jpg "09")

__The helpful guy in the red hat__  
It was a red Cornell lacrosse cap, and it belonged to Marc Ewing, one of Red Hat’s co-founders.  
Marc wore his grandfather’s red hat while working in the computer lab at Carnegie Mellon, helping fellow students.  
Marc was well-known for his competence and willingness to share his knowledge and expertise.  
“If you need help, look for the guy in the red hat,” people would say.  
When Marc started distributing his personally curated version of Linux®, he named it Red Hat.  

![10](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/10.jpg "10")
Here is one sentence in that page I was noticed  
![12](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/12.jpg "12")
"If you need help, Look for the guy in the red hat."  
Yes , first of all be the professional guy, next help other once they asked.  

![13](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/13.jpg "13")
So that is what I design the tatto on my right arm.  

![14](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/14.jpg "14")

![15](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/15.jpg "15")
![16](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/16.jpg "16")

Yes, It is real , I will take that for my personal memory tag,  I do have a great memory here, and I have lots of thing I want to do here.  
Someone will ask what if Red Hat changes their logo again ?   
I think that OK , we all grow up as the time goes by  that logo style will showing that at that period of time Fine was here.  
![17](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/17.jpg "17")

When I on borading , I was aked to join the CPR & AED training, at that time I just know that if someone blackout and hit the ground you can not put him/her back to earth by just electric shock of the AED device, you have to do the CPR before and after, until the doctor take it over. I think I will never know this if I not one of the Red Hatter.

![18](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/18.jpg "18")
We are software company , one of the OpenSource software developing company, but I won't show your the coding things on my slide but I will use the Puzzle event to show how we are collaborate together.  


![19](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/19.jpg "19")
Here is the thing there will be an email sent by GWS who is the holder of that event in our company, and there will be an openned puzzle box in the pantry table in the morning, people comeing to the office and take a look and will slove some of the parts if they are interesting, and little by little about at evening  all the puzzle will be sloved.  
I think that's a great example to show how we developing our softwares and how the open orgnazation works.

![20](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/20.jpg "20")
There are about 8 book shelfs and more than 300 books in these book shelfs in Raycom 9 floor pantry, all the books are opened for reading ,you can see there are glass doors but they aren't locked , cause we want everybody could just pickup an interesting book and start reading.  
And more than 80% of these book are donated by Red Hat associates, there only about 20% books is bought by the company.
   
![21](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/21.jpg "21")

As you could feel that there were a big pantry here, I would like to say that pantry is where the maigc happens.  
You could see people hold events there in the workday , and you could find out some of our fellows will come to the pantry at the weekend just for play the table cards, and still some assocate will sharing their interesting things here like the third picture above is the VR helmet there.

![22](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/22.jpg "22")

And people learn English songs there , it is the \<wellerman\>  and people said "Oh well that how I speaking like a native speaker"

![23](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/23.jpg "23")
During Summer and Winter vacation there will be children in the office,  most of them are at the age who can not sit on chair for hours , well some of the Red Hatters bring his console game device to the office to make sure both of the children and associates will have a great time in the office.

![24](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/24.jpg "24")
Family Day is another great part of children's precious memory  which is hold by GWS department, there will be magic shows , big cake, and story parts , ice cream machine , claw machine , Yes kidz love it

![25](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/25.jpg "25")
Little Fellows,  Yeah these two cute kidz is most impression in my memory , one of them lay on the ground cause he got a machine in the VR game , and he thinks the machinegunner should lay on the ground to shooting.  
Another  little fellows  just did the one funny  things I've never did and always want to do during the meeting.

![26](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/26.jpg "26")

Back to the pantry, there are not only  magic shows for children but also magic happens when the assocates meet eacher other here, people just stop and star talking , sometimes you have noidead which department they are comes from , and sometime you can not call out all of their name but the topic keeps going on ,and solutions comes out, people just "OK  I got Thank you ! " and turn around quickly back to their site coding the new idea into git repo and runs them. For the department , name , manager or just qe no idea.

![27](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/27.jpg "27")

And when we back to the site, the magic keep happening,  people just stand up and go there start discussion , and there always a solutions comes out after few minutes. Well , in this picture above you could tell who is the manager.

![28](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/28.jpg "28")
And magic keep happening in both of the office , Red Hat has two offices in Beijing, Raycom office and the Parkview office. There are engineers in the Raycome office who is faceing the balck screen with endless gray text scroll up  everyday, and our sales are in the Parkview office who has the most frontline experience that how the gray text real works in the customer's factory.  
So there will be events that holding across the offices sales comes Raycom office showing how the product helps customer,  engineers comes to Parkview office showing how the gray text add new fucntions and how to use the new functions.  
![29](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/29.jpg "29")

Cause I am a game player , so this behaviour in my mind  is like   __Minecraft: Also try Terraria__ ,  __Terarria: Also try Minecraft__  two leggends sandbox game like each other.  
![30](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/30.jpg "30")

Back to the culture thing, I think one of the most important things is that how we call each other.  
In Red Hat we call each other by Direct Name, Nick name, English Name , Bro, Fellow ,just what you call your family member.  
![31](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/31.jpg "31")
And another important part I think it is how I feels when I work with my manager, I think it is like the space-ship and the ground base, I give him the __real feedback__ and my manger gives me __effective help__.  
If you really comes to my working table you will find out that are a funny table on my desk I put my manager's face on that and add __Focus ,Fine__  to help me to keep focus, it works.  
Another screen shot is showing that I just say no to my manager , without thinking , cause in Red Hat there is a trusted safe working environment.

![32](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/32.jpg "32")

Well comes to this part, __The Master & Thew newbie__   I am the newbie , one day I got duty to test some other modules but there nobody knows what it is , and how to play with it.After asking around I got an 2hours online meeting with the author's help who is __The Master__  , So I just record that meeting keep watching it for 1 week and write down 78pages notes to learn that module. That is how I grow druing daily work in Red Hat.  

I've learned from a Master.!!!   

![33](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/33.jpg "33")
In Red Hat there are EAP hot line , that supports you when you feel sad. It is Global Employee Assistance Program , paied by Red Hat.  
I wasn't deal that number before , but I've heard some of the stories , all in one word is : it works!  

<!-- ![34](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/34.jpg "34") -->
<!-- ![35](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/35.jpg "35") -->

![36](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/36.jpg "36")

In Red Hat there are many tools in the company , and all of them are in the inner git  repo , which means you could just clone it add your feature to it , if your version getting popular people will clone that too.  
It is kind of Burst of creativity  and people will learn a lot during that process.  



![37](/images/2023-12-26-COSCon_China2023/37.jpg "37")
Working at Red Hat makes me feels like we are building Babel Tower,  
We are cooperating across the divide:  
Territory  
Race  
Complexion  
Faith  
Language  
Educational Background  
Family  
...  
...  

etc
