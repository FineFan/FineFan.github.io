After I've on boarded Red Hat in 2019, I got a Red Hat tatoo on my right arm.   
Here is my story about why I doing that.   


在我2019年入职了红帽软件以后，我在我的右胳膊上面纹上了红帽的标志纹身。    
这篇博客就是来说一下为什么我要这么做。

# Why I doing this ?  为什么我要这么做？

Cause I have great memory here.  
因为我在这里有美好的回忆。  

You know , there always some guys/girls talking about their colleges memories after drunk a bunch of beers even tough he/she had graduated from colleges more than 10 years.  
我总是会遇到一些人，在一吃饭喝了点啤酒，就开始讨论他们当年在大学里面的各种回忆，尽管有些人可能已经毕业10多年了。

But while they are talking about that part of their memory , the lights comes out of their eyes.   
但是，当他们在谈论的那段记忆的时候，你能看到他们眼中发出的光芒。  

Life is short , Don't have that much decades,  Great to have some precious memories to going with.    
人生苦短，十年无多，幸有珍忆相伴。

# Any regret after having that tatoo?   纹了纹身之后有什么后悔的吗？

During COVID  I had watched some documentaries about how the hospital works, and I decided to donated blood every year.    
在疫情期间，我看了一些关于医院的纪录片，随后便决定每年献一次血。  

At that year I was not able to donate blood for a whole year, but I continued to do so the following year.  
纹身的那一整年我不能去献血了，但是第二年我就继续去献血了。

持续学习，变得更专业，帮助更多的人。
